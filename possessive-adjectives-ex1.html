            <h2>How to do the activities</h2>
            <p>Follow the instructions in each exercise. After finishing the exercise, once you get everything right, it's EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you go back and read all the sentences ALOUD.</p>
            <p>You will be tempted to move to the next activity, because your brain wants to feel good by the quantity of activities done. However, we are not here to make your brain feel good, but to help you learn English.</p>
            <p>You will only feel comfortable with what you learn once you are able to express it naturally and that only comes with repetition. Remember, understanding the rule is not the same as being able to apply it. Different parts of the brain. Both need specific practice.</p>
            <p>So, once you have finished the activity, don't forget to read them aloud. Do that for EVERY EXERCISE IN THIS WEBSITE.</p>
            <p>Good luck!</p>
